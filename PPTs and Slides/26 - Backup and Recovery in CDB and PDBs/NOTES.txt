I was working on my presentations for IOUG Collaborate, and I came upon this strange behaviour in RMAN 12c (12.1.0.1.0) which to me, shouldn’t happen. Seems that when you do a DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE , it is the equivalent of DROP DATABASE INCLUDING BACKUPS. This means that if you need to restore your PDB later on, you won’t have this registered – just be careful when dropping them.

If you have a valid RMAN backups then do the following and it will work:
1) Create a new Auxiliary instance, and do a RMAN restore for the following PDBS only : ROOT, PDB$SEED and the Dropped PDB that needs to be restored.

2) Open this newly created Auxiliary instance.

3) You should be able to see all the 3 PDB (root, pdb$seed and dropped PDB) with all the datafiles.

4) Follow the process of unplugging and then plugging in this dropped PDB from the restored auxiliary instance into the original source CDB and you should be all set.

5) Drop the Auxiliary instance now.
